## SNAP potential for NbMoTaW Multi-Principal Element Alloy system

This directory contains the SNAP force field parameters for NbMoTaW Multi-Principal Element Alloy system. This potential is fitted from the DFT data, including,
```
- Undistorted ground state structures for Nb, Mo, Ta, W;
- Distorted structures constructed by applying different strains to a bulk supercell;
- Surface structures of elemental structures;
- DFT calculated molecular dynamics trajectories for bulk supercells at different volumes and temperatures;
- Binary solite solution structures;
- Multinary Special Quasi-random Structures and their AIMD trajectories at different temperatures;
```

The hyperparameter tuning and fitting procedures are described in detail in our publication [1] and thus are excluded from the repo.
